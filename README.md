## Chessreader

For now is a simple chess widget made with [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5) and 
[python-chess](https://pypi.org/project/python-chess). The general intend is to convert 
this widget into a pgn reader where you could also play chess.
I also made use of [Fuge Icons](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/).

* To install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* To execute the program just make:
```bash
python main.py
```
